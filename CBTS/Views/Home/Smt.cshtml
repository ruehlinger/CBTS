                The Supervisory and Management Training (SMT) Program is a blended two-week cohort training providing new VBA supervisors with the foundation and tools needed for a successful transition into supervisory leadership roles.  SMT consists of five (5) Instructor-led, Web-based Training (IWT) modules to increase their leadership awareness, and a one-week Residential session focusing on managerial technical training held at the VBA Professional Development Academy in Baltimore, Maryland. A pre-requisite for enrollment into SMT is completion of the 20-hour New Supervisor Soft-Skills Training (NSSST) Program; it consists of five (5) self-paced modules within the VA Talent Management System (TMS).  A pre- and post-test is administered in NSSST and the SMT Residential session to assess the degree of learning.
