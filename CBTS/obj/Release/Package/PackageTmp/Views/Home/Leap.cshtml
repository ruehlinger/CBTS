                The Leadership Enrichment and Progression (LEAP) Program (formerly LDP) is designed as a national leadership development program for current GS12-14 employees within the various business lines and staff offices of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).  This program seeks to enrich the participants’ leadership knowledge and competencies by engaging them in critical thought, independent and group learning activities, as well as ongoing writing assignments.  This program places emphasis on the individual leader, as participants will reflect and analyze their leadership style and job functionalities in conjunction with their personal career development plans.  Throughout the duration of the program, the participant will be responsible for completing a Capstone project that encapsulates the knowledge gained and lessons learned during the program.
